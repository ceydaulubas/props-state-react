# PROPS

Piece of information that com from outside of the components
<br/>
Another way to describ them is they are the data passes into the component .
<br/>
Props are read-only meaning a component must never modify its own props. 


# STATE

Object is where you store property values that belongs to the component.
<br/>
When the state object changes the component re-render.
<br/>
You can see state examples in Counter folders. There are 3 ways you can use it, but the old method isn't recommended.
